<h1>Web Terminology</h1>

<h2>Part One: Solidify Terminology</h2>

<h3>1. What is HTTP?</h3>
<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol for transferring data across the web.
   This can be anything from HTML documents,javaScript files, css stylesheets, images
   and more. HTTP allows for communication between different systems, generally a server
   and browser. Each request is independently processed without knowledge of prior requests.
</p>

<h3>2. What is a URL?</h3>
<p>Uniformed Resource Locator (url) is a reference or address that states a location of a resource
   like a web page on the internet. It carries the protocol needed to fetch the resource.
   Urls consist of standardized format that has several parts.
</p>

<h3>3. What is DNS?</h3>
<p>DNS or Domain Name System is a crucial component of the internet's infrastructure, like a phone book
   for the internet. When we are surfing the web the DNS translates domain names within the url like
   'yahoo.com' to an IP address allowing our browser to load requested resource known as DNS resolution.</p>

<h3>4. What is a query string?</h3>
<p>A query string is indicated with a question mark and is located inside the URL. It generally specifies
   certain conditions or provides additional data for the HTTP request. It consists of a series of parameter-value
   pairs that are separated by an ampersand. It allows for passing specific information to a web server.</p>

<h3>5. What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</h3>
<p>GET and POST are two HTTP methods (or verbs). Verbs define an action to be performed on specified resource. There
   are many methods (or verbs) but we are focusing on GET and POST.

   GET: retrieves data from a server. When you type a URL into a browser and hit search, a GET request is being sent
   to a server from your browser. One key point is GET request should not change the state of the server being "safe".
   Meaning they do not modify any data and are used for read-only purposes.

   POST: sends data to a server to create/update a resource. The POST is placed within the body of a request, which will
   not be visible in URL. Unlike the GET verb that does not change the server state; POST does as it is used to update an
   existing resource or create a new one.</p>

<h3>6. What is an HTTP request?</h3>
<p>An HTTP request is made from a client to a web server to obtain a specific action on a requested resource.</p>

<h3>7. What is an HTTP response?</h3>
<p>An HTTP response is made by the server to the client. It informs the client on the status of the request made.</p>

<h3>8. What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</h3>
<p>An HTTP header is used by either client or server to pass additional information between the two during the request/
   response cycle. Headers come in a variety of types and appear in both request and response. It's a way pass information
   between the two.

   Example request:
   Get /erik.price.75 HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.facebook.com
   User-Agent: Chrome/91.0.4472.124
   Accept-Language: it-IT, it;q=0.9, en;q=0.8

   Example request 2:
   GET /community-1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: springboard-2784014.hs-sites.com
   User-Agent: Chrome/91.0.4472.124
   Accept-Language: it-IT, it;q=0.9, en;q=0.8

   Example response:
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Server: Apache/2.4.1 (unix)
   Last-Modified: Mon, 02 May 2022 12:45:26 GMT
   Content-Language: it
   Content-Type: text/html;
   charset=UTF-8
   Connection: close

   Example response 2:
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Mon, 06 July 2024 16:01:05 GMT
   Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
   Last-Modified: Mon, 06 July 2024 12:30:20 GMT
   Content-Language: it
   Content-Type: text/html;
   charset=UTF-8
   Connection: close
</p>

<h3>9. What are the processes that happen when you type "http://somesite.com/some/page.html" into a browser?</h3>

<ul>
      <li><strong>URL parsing:</strong> The URL gets parsed to identify the "http".</li>
     <li><strong>DNS Lookup:</strong> The browser connects to a DNS server to translate the domain name to the ip address.</li>
     <li><strong>TCP Connection:</strong> A protocol used to deliver a request from client to server. Your browser will establish a connection
     with the server and carry out above protocol.</li>
     <li><strong>HTTP Request:</strong> A browser sends an HTTP GET request to a server.</li>
     <li><strong>Server Response:</strong> The server reacts to HTTP request. The server then sends back file content back to the browser in
     HTTP response. If it is successful you can get a response with "200 OK" and if it is not than you can get "404 Not
     Found".</li>
     <li><strong>Rendering the Page:</strong> Once the requested webpage has been received the browser then starts making available the HTML code.
     It can send additional HTTP requests for whatever the webpage requires like images, JavaScript files, CSS files, etc.</li>
     <li><strong>Closing the Connection:</strong> After the request has been completely loaded the browser closes the TCP connection. In some
     instances the connection is kept open to fetch other resources or cater to more request to server.</li>
  </ul>
