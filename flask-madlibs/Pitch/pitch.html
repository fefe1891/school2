<p class="pitch">
    As an aspiring developer, I've immersed myself in coding languages
    such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even started exploring Python recently.
    My key focus is Web Development, especially coding responsive design
    layouts, DOM manipulation, and developing proficiency in jQuery and AJAX
    functionality. I also familiarized myself with the command-line interface
    of Git for version control. My experience also extends to dabbling in
    test-driven development with Jasmine.
    I'm eager to apply these skills in a real-world setting, either through
    internships or collaborative projects. If you have any opportunity that
    requires a fast-learning, dedicated fresh developer, I would love to
    connect and explore possibilities.
