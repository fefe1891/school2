    <p class="question 4">What is hoisting:</p>
    <p class ="answer">This is how the js compiler is explained. Variables are hoisted(lifted) to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using var you can access the variable name & and it's undefined value before being later used.
    function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked before they are defined in a code base</p>
